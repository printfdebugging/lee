# lee

Lee is my personal project, which will start as a text editor. Later I will add
more functionalities to it like making extensible, adding support for remote access,
creating a client-server arcitecture, adding treesitter support, lspclient,
dap client..

This is going to be a long project, and I have to start somewhere. I don't know
anything about OpenGL or GFLW, other than that they are used for drawing to a
buffer, and display it on the screen.

```sh
sudo pacman -S glfw # install glfw on Archlinux
```

Here are a few resources that I consulted during this project. Since GLFW is mostly
about creating a window, I had to learn OpenGL in order to get something usefull.

- [Anton's OpenGL 4 Tutorials - Brave](https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/)
- [Learn OpenGL, extensive tutorial resource for learning Modern OpenGL - Brave](https://learnopengl.com/)
- [GLFW: Getting started - Brave](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html)
- [GLFW: Introduction - Brave](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/)
